            <p>The Park is one of Qu&eacute;bec's most beautiful natural monuments. It was named after a series of valleys cut deep into a range of high mountains. Steep slopes, beautiful natural surroundings, and the unusual course of Rivi&egrave;re Malbaie make this site unique in Eastern Canada.
            This backcountry marvel in the heart of the Charlevoix World Biosphere Reserve can be reached via the picturesque village of Saint-Aim&eacute;-des-Lacs.</p>

          <h5>Jacques-Cartier National Park</h5>
            <p>Just 30 minutes from Qu&eacute;bec City, you will fall under the spell of a vast mountainous plateau cut by deep valleys. Parc national de la Jacques-Cartier is host to one of the most beautiful glacial valleys in Qu&eacute;bec, the spectacular Vall&eacute;e de la Jacques-Cartier. The Jacques Cartier River, calm in some places and turbulent in others, has sliced a 550-metre-deep channel into the plateau. A coniferous forest dominates the high plateaus, and deciduous trees populate the deep valleys. Here, nature is both inspiring and serene.</p>  

          <h5>Grands-Jardins National Park</h5>
            <p>In the early 20th century, this area was already known for its incredible fishing opportunities. Visitors were struck by the carpets of ground lichen and the exceptional Arctic vegetation at this latitude. They thus named it the Grands-Jardins, the Great Gardens. Today, Parc national des Grands-Jardins is still visited by anglers and also by hikers, campers and vacationers. It has the privilege of forming one of the core zones of the Charlevoix Biosphere Reserve, a status granted to the region by UNESCO.</p>

        <h4 id="atlantic">The Atlantic Provinces</h4>
          <h5>Gros Morne National Park, Newfoundland and Labrador</h5>

Lord of the Rings-like terrain aside, recent glacial action has resulted in even more incredible scenery such as alpine plateau, coastal lowlands, glacial valleys, sheer cliffs, waterfalls, pristine lakes, and freshwater fjords - all of which create an eye-popping landscape.</p>

          <h5>Prince Edward Island National Park, Prince Edward Island</h5>
            <p>Discover the stunning beauty of the Island's North Shore on the seven supervised beaches and over 50 km of hiking and cycling trails in PEI National Park.

            <br>
            The Dempster Highway bisects the park and provides an opportunity to view stunning arctic tundra landscapes and wildlife and access to hiking areas. The concentration of wide ecological niches has resulted in a diverse collection of flora and fauna uncommon at this latitude.</p>

          <h5>Vuntut National Park</h5>
            <p>Remote and unspoiled Arctic wilderness, a First Nation's history dating back millennia and the setting for one of the planet's great animal migrations await the few who make the trek to Vuntut National Park.
            Vuntut National Park may be one of the most remote and least visited national parks in Canada, but it's far from unpopulated. Vuntut is the domain of the Porcupine caribou herd and half a million migratory birds, and is also the cultural homeland of the Vuntut Gwich'in people. In the Gwich'in language, vuntut means "among the lakes," a fitting moniker for this Arctic landscape, which is dotted by fertile wetlands, winding rivers, and rolling mountains.</p>

The name means "stands like a porcupine" in the Dene language, given to it because of its distinctive shape. Near the Yukon-Northwest Territories border, the park is in the traditional lands of the Sh&uacute;htaot'ine (Mountain Dene), and home to grizzly bear, Dall's Sheep, Mountain Goats and Woodland Caribou.</p>

            <h5>Nahanni National Park Reserve of Canada</h5>
              <p>The Cirque of the Unclimbables' granite spires rise out of the lush alpine meadow, at N&aacute;&#303;l&#303;cho (Virginia Falls) the South Nahanni River surges over a drop twice the height of Niagara Falls. Nahanni National Park Reserve, encompassing 30,000 square kilometers, is a designated UNESCO world heritage site.

          <h5>Auyuittuq National Park</h5>
            <p>A zig-zag skyline of craggy granite peaks and glittering glaciers overlooks tundra valleys and steep-walled fiords whose winding waterways teem with narwhal and ringed seals, Auyuittuq is a diverse and grand-scale Arctic experience.

            <p>Kugluk (Bloody Falls) Territorial Park is located 13 kilometres (six miles) southwest of Kugluktuk. The park features 25 acres of lush terrain alongside a narrow gorge on the Coppermine River where the water swiftly descends in a thundering cascade of churning rapids and twisting eddies. This special place, known as Kugluk in the local Inuinnaqtun dialect, has a rich and continuous history that is shared by the Dene and Inuit cultures and their ancestors dating back more than 7,000 years. The ancient travel corridor of the Coppermine River valley with its plentiful natural resources brought various cultures to Kugluk (Bloody Falls) for millennia. Fish heading upstream are forced into shallow channels at the falls, enabling people to easily catch them with traditional hooks and spears from the shore. The traditional campsite area located below the falls is called ‘Onoagahiovik,’ meaning ‘the place where you stay all night’ because the fishing is that good!</p>  

          <h5>Ukkusiksalik National Park</h5>
            <p>Polar bears, grizzlies, Arctic wolves and caribou - Ukkusiksalik’s rolling ochre hills and lush tundra thrive with wildlife, and are dotted with archeological reminders of human cultures passing for millennia through this remote wilderness, as well as some more recent colonial historical artifacts. Paddle or boat an inland sea amid beluga whales and seals. Snowmobile across the frozen sea. Hike through wildflowers and in the company of stone inuksuk beneath the glow of the Midnight Sun.</p>
