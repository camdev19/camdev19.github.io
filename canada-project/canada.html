        Vuntut National Park may be one of the most remote and least visited national parks in Canada, but it's far from unpopulated. Vuntut is the domain of the Porcupine caribou herd and half a million migratory birds, and is also the cultural homeland of the Vuntut Gwich'in people. In the Gwich'in language, vuntut means "among the lakes," a fitting moniker for this Arctic landscape, which is dotted by fertile wetlands, winding rivers, and rolling mountains.</p>

        <p>Kugluk (Bloody Falls) Territorial Park is located 13 kilometres (six miles) southwest of Kugluktuk. The park features 25 acres of lush terrain alongside a narrow gorge on the Coppermine River where the water swiftly descends in a thundering cascade of churning rapids and twisting eddies. This special place, known as Kugluk in the local Inuinnaqtun dialect, has a rich and continuous history that is shared by the Dene and Inuit cultures and their ancestors dating back more than 7,000 years. The ancient travel corridor of the Coppermine River valley with its plentiful natural resources brought various cultures to Kugluk (Bloody Falls) for millennia. Fish heading upstream are forced into shallow channels at the falls, enabling people to easily catch them with traditional hooks and spears from the shore. The traditional campsite area located below the falls is called ‘Onoagahiovik,’ meaning ‘the place where you stay all night’ because the fishing is that good!</p>
